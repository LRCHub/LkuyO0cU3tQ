It′s time to
unveil the hype y'all
been waiting for
It′s time to
bring an end to question of
who will win?
It's us
I used to have bad feeling
Premonition of falling short
Now I have no fear since
we're here
To fight it together
I believe
we can fly up in the sky
One day we may just
be able to touch down on a star
Off the road we have to go
The roadless path
we shall proceed until the end
of our roles
There′s no turning back for us
′cause we will never give up
I thought that
I told you I'm not a robot, no
I thought
I told you
I′m not a phantom
I'm in your face
It′s time to show
everything we got
To find a way out
from this fake mirage
Our life is happening
in front of you,
right now
It's time to seize it
I believe
we can fly up in the sky
One day we may just
be able to touch down on a star
Off the road we have to go
The roadless path we shall
proceed until the end
of our roles
There′s no turning back for us
'cause we will never give up
It's our turn to get back
To grab the future
which we fully believe
And it′s not given to us
It′s earned
And I believe
we can fly up in the sky
One day we may just
be able to touch down on a star
Off the road we have to go
The roadless path we shall
proceed until the end
of our roles
There's no turning back
for us
Because you know that
I believe
we can fly up in the sky
One day we may just
be able to touch down on a star
Off the road we have to go
The roadless path we shall
proceed until the end
of our roles
There′s no turning back
for us 'cause we will
never give up
